some general notes.
this is not going to be a fully fledged independent soundpack, we're basically adding more functionalities to the oficial  soundpack.
here's how it's going to work.
the directory structure will be the same, with no files, we dont want to fork the soundpack files until we've made any changes to them. we'll add the files only which will be changed. so we could save ourselves some data.
there will be 2 additional files though. general notes(extended).txt and changelog(extended).txt in the help folder.
changelog(extended).txt will keep track of the new functionalities / bug fixes
we're going to make, with the files you need to copy. this part won't be explained, we expect you to use this particular pack only if you're avair of what you are doing. at your own risk.
if the oficial soundpack owners  tinker around with the files we editid, we'll update the files with their new change as soon as possible and you could copy them. you'll have to keep track of what aditional files we've editid though. we'll soon make a list of files we've editid for you to keep a track in the near future.
you may be wondering, what benifits do you get by using these additional files...
you could  request for sounds for your personal stuff such as, custom music for your house / moon / rooms, custom sounds for emotes of your pet / babies, etc.
that's all you need to know, have fun.
